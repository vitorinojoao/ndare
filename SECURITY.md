# Security Policy

## Finding an Issue

If NDARE is not working as expected in your use case, please check the API Reference in the official documentation.  
If the official documentation does not describe such possibility, there may be an issue in the source code.  

When an issue has a security impact in regular use cases that should be stable, it is important to report it.  

## Reporting an Issue

Please report possible issues by email to: [jpmvo@outlook.com](mailto:jpmvo@outlook.com?subject=[NDARE]%20Security%20Issue)  
The report should include the following information:

1. A short description of the issue.
2. A detailed description of the use case.
3. A detailed description of the security impact.
4. A minimal reproducible example code.

If the issue is confirmed, a security patch will be released as soon as possible.  
If you request it, you will be credited for finding and reporting the issue.
